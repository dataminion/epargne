# Epargne Plannifier
 
 Epargne Plannifier is a web application developed to help manager savings plans. 
 
 The code base has been frozen since 2010. 
 
 This code base is POC that was designed at the beginning of my career as a developer. I cannot warn you enough to not install this. Don't install it... don't use it...
 
 Its the first end to end full stack application that I ever built so I feel its important to be honest about it
